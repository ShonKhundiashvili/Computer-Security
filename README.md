# Computer-security
This project is a secure website built using JavaScript, ExpressJS, and React. The website has been designed and implemented with robust security measures in place to effectively prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Features
Secure Input Handling: All user input is properly validated and sanitized before being used in any database queries or displayed on the website, ensuring protection against SQL injection attacks.

Output Encoding: All user-generated content displayed on the website is properly encoded to prevent potential cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. This ensures that any malicious scripts or HTML tags are rendered as plain text, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
